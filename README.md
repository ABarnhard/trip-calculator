#Trip-Calculator
===============
###The best wildly innacurate MPG estimator on the market
===============
This simple JavaScript & [Node](http://nodejs.org/) console app prompts the user for input regarding a theoretical trip
and estimates the total cost of gas for the trip. The app demostrates basic use of:
1. Sync-prompt installed via NPM
2. Conditional logic
3. Primitive type conversion
4. General understanding of md syntax(:boom:)
