===============
######The best wildly innacurate MPG estimator on the market

This simple JavaScript & [Node](http://nodejs.org/) console app prompts the user for input regarding a theoretical trip
and estimates the total cost of gas for the trip. The app demostrates basic use of:
* Sync-prompt installed via NPM
* Conditional logic
* Primitive type conversion
* General understanding of md syntax(:boom:)
